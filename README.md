2) Clone the repository for the Eyes & Ears project into your preferred IDE
3) Run the command ```npm install``` in your terminal and follow all steps to install
4) Now run the following commands: ```cd frontend``` ```npm run dev```
5) Open a second terminal and navigate to the backend folder
6) Run the command "node server.js"
7) Click the link to the local host to open the project

If you recieve an error about your computer not allowing you to run scripts, you will need to enable that in your computer's powershell before the project can be ran.

Currently, the software has a functional homepage that will let you move between pages. On the Instruments page, you will be able to see a list of available high school instruments and add them to your list of instruments.
