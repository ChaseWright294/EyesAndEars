/**
 * Memoizes a method.
 *
 * This decorator is backed by an LRU cache to avoid memory leaks. Each argument provided can yield another LRU true if
 * there are arguments after it. The `degree` parameter is the capacity of each LRU cache "level". It must be declared
 * statically.
 *
 * NOTE: LRU caches depend on _identity_ for indexing. If you need values to resolve based on _equivalency_, do not use
 * this decorator.
